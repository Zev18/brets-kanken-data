# brets-kanken-data

This repo represents data collected from [Bret Mayer's Kanji Website](https://www.bretmayer.com/kanji.html) presented in xml format for processing.

### Bret... who?

Bret Mayer is the first person born outside of Japan or China to pass the highest level of the Kanji Kentei exam. On top of this incredible acheivement, he has also made a website full of resources for studying for the Kanji Kentei. Conveniently, his website logs all the data to the client's console in a nice, big json. I converted it all to xml just because that's easier to work with in ruby. Yes I use rails, sue me.

### Isn't this stealing?

Good question. I honestly have no idea.

I don't know if it's even possible to copyright something as simple as a word list. The words themselves can't be copyrighted obviously, but maybe his English translations can? But then again, how many different ways can you translate the same word? Ok, maybe the mneumonics he made up are copyrighted, so don't use those in your project. But he didn't put the copyright sign anywhere on his website last time I checked. So I really have no idea. I'm not a lawyer.

I tried reaching out to him to ask for permission, but got no response. So if he finds this one day and asks me to take it down, I will. But if he's chill with it, then great, we all win! Yippee!!

### So that's why there's no lisence...

Yeah. This isn't my data, and I don't know if anyone has the right to use it. Use at your own peril. I won't go after you, but he might.
